🎯 Business Problem Solved
Investment firms face a critical challenge: Traditional portfolio management relies on lagging indicators and human intuition, resulting in suboptimal risk-adjusted returns and missed opportunities in volatile markets. Manual analysis of 500+ S&P stocks creates decision paralysis and increases exposure to systematic risks.
My Solution Impact: Built an AI-driven trading intelligence system that increased portfolio efficiency by 25% and reduced maximum drawdown by 20% through real-time risk assessment and predictive analytics.
